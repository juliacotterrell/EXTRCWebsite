      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This project investigates how the computational efficiency of <strong>Rational Closure</strong> (RC) in
        <em>defeasible reasoning</em> can be improved without affecting logical soundness. RC provides a way for
        artificial intelligence systems to reason about exceptions and uncertainty, but its sequential nature
        limits scalability. Three optimisation techniques were implemented — <strong>parallelisation</strong>,
        <strong>sub-query memoization</strong>, and <strong>multi-rank traversal</strong> — to reduce runtime across
        knowledge bases of increasing size and complexity. Together, these techniques achieved up to a
        95–99% reduction in runtime compared to the baseline sequential implementation

      <h2>Introduction & Aims</h2>
      <p>
        Rational Closure (RC) provides a structured approach for drawing cautious conclusions when information
        contains exceptions. Although theoretically robust, RC’s sequential entailment checks make it slow for
        large knowledge bases. This work aims to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimise RC’s runtime performance through targeted computational enhancements.</li>
        <li>Preserve the algorithm’s integrity and logical correctness during optimisation.</li>
        <li>Evaluate scalability across different dataset sizes and query types.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By applying parallelisation, caching, and adaptive traversal methods, the study sought to make
        Rational Closure practical for large-scale reasoning in explainable AI systems

    <!-- RELATED WORK -->
    <section>
      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      <p>
        Prior implementations of Rational Closure relied on sequential entailment, as first formalised by
        Lehmann and Magidor. Although sound, these versions suffered from exponential time growth as knowledge
        bases increased in complexity. Later work by Casini, Giordano, and Straccia introduced syntactic and
        semantic improvements but retained the sequential core. Recent studies explored scalability through
        caching, distributed computing, and graphical reasoning tools, yet few directly addressed optimisation
        of RC’s core execution loop. This project builds upon these foundations by experimentally comparing
        multiple optimisation strategies under identical conditions to evaluate both correctness and speed.

    <!-- OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUES -->
    <section>
      <h2>Optimisation Techniques</h2>

      <h3>1. Parallelisation</h3>
      <p>
        Parallelisation executes entailment checks for multiple queries simultaneously, leveraging multi-core
        processing to reduce wall-clock time. Each query runs as an isolated task, ensuring deterministic
        results while maintaining thread safety. This approach achieved average speed-ups of 85–89% across
        large knowledge bases, with identical outputs to the sequential baseline.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Sub-query Memoization</h3>
      <p>
        Memoization stores the results of previously computed sub-queries to prevent redundant computation.
        Each entailment check generates a unique key from the query and the ranked knowledge base, ensuring
        correctness and reusability. This reduced execution time by 40–46% for workloads containing repeated
        or partially overlapping queries.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Multi-Rank Traversal</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional RC checks ranks linearly. Multi-rank traversal introduces adaptive strategies that switch
        between <em>Naive</em>, <em>Binary</em>, or <em>Ternary</em> search depending on the depth of the
        knowledge base. For small rank depths, linear scanning is efficient; for deeper structures, ternary
        traversal reduces the total number of checks. This adaptability preserved correctness while improving
        scalability for deeper or more complex reasoning tasks.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The combined use of parallelisation, caching, and adaptive traversal produced substantial performance
        improvements without altering logical outcomes. The best-performing configurations paired
        <strong>parallelisation</strong> with <strong>cached traversal</strong>, achieving up to 99% faster execution
        relative to the baseline. These findings demonstrate that Rational Closure — a foundational logic for
        defeasible reasoning — can be efficiently scaled for practical AI applications without sacrificing
        correctness.
