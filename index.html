    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The EXTRC project explores ways to make Rational Closure (RC) — a core reasoning method in Artificial Intelligence — more efficient, interpretable, and accessible. 
        Across three linked studies, the project developed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A scalable reasoning engine optimised for performance.</li>
        <li>A user interface and debugger to visualise and explain reasoning steps.</li>
        <li>A natural language generator to translate symbolic logic into human-understandable sentences.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Background -->
    <section id="background">
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <h3>Propositional Logic</h3>
      <p>
        Propositional logic is the foundation of reasoning in Artificial Intelligence. It represents knowledge using simple statements — or propositions — that can be true or false.
      </p>
      <blockquote>“Cars use petrol.”<br>“Electric cars are cars.”</blockquote>
      <p>
        Using classical logic, if both are true, we would also conclude “Electric cars use petrol.” This clearly isn’t correct. 
        Classical logic assumes that once something is true, it always remains true — even when exceptions exist. This limitation motivates more flexible reasoning methods.
      </p>

      <h3>Defeasible Reasoning</h3>
      <p>
        Defeasible reasoning provides a way for computers to change their conclusions when exceptions arise. 
        It mirrors how humans reason — we know that “cars typically use petrol,” but also accept that “electric cars are an exception.” 
        This type of reasoning allows AI to handle uncertainty and contradiction much like humans do.
      </p>

      <h3>The KLM Framework</h3>
      <p>
        To formalize defeasible reasoning, Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor developed the KLM Framework, 
        which introduces typicality into logic — considering not just what is true, but what is typically true.
      </p>
      <blockquote>“Cars typically use petrol.”<br>“Electric cars typically do not use petrol.”</blockquote>
      <p>
        The KLM Framework ranks information by how typical or exceptional it is, allowing more specific rules 
        (like those about electric cars) to take priority in conflicts.
      </p>

      <h3>Rational Closure</h3>
      <p>
        Rational Closure (RC) is a reasoning method built on the KLM Framework. 
        It provides a structured way to decide what conclusions can safely be drawn in the presence of exceptions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>RC concludes: “Electric cars are still cars, but they don’t use petrol.”</blockquote>
      <p>
        RC helps AI reason cautiously — making logical conclusions while respecting exceptions. 
        The EXTRC project improves its speed, clarity, and accessibility through optimisation, visualisation, and natural language tools.

    <!-- Aims -->
    <section id="aims">
      <h2>Aims</h2>
      <p>
        The overarching aim is to make Rational Closure faster, clearer, and more human-friendly.
        Specifically, the combined objectives were to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimise the RC algorithm for large and complex knowledge bases.</li>
        <li>Design a user interface to visualise reasoning steps and outputs transparently.</li>
        <li>Generate natural-language explanations that preserve logical correctness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Collectively, these aims advance explainable and scalable reasoning for research, education, and intelligent systems.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Knowledge Base Generator -->
    <section id="knowledgebase">
      <h2>Knowledge Base Generator</h2>
      <p><strong>Lead:</strong> Jethro Dunn</p>
      <p>
        Jethro’s work used Gemini, SBERT, and KenLM models to convert symbolic implications into clear English sentences.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Main Finding:</strong> LLM-generated sentences were on average 3.4× more understandable than manually written ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> SBERT and Gemini evaluations aligned strongly, validating the approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> No human trial (“gold standard”) conducted, but automated agreement confirmed reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution:</strong> Introduced a natural-language bridge between logical reasoning systems and human users, enhancing explainability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Optimisation Techniques -->
    <section id="optimisation">
      <h2>Optimisation Techniques</h2>
      <p><strong>Lead:</strong> Nevaniah Gounden</p>
      <p>
        Implemented and benchmarked multiple optimisation strategies for RC, including parallelisation, sub-query memoization, and hybrid rank traversal with caching.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance Gains:</strong> Parallelisation reduced runtime by 85–89% on large query sets.</li>
        <li>Memoization improved mixed workloads by 40–46%.</li>
        <li>Combined setup achieved up to 99% faster performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> All optimised versions produced identical logical results to standard RC.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Demonstrated that RC can scale to large knowledge bases without losing logical soundness.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Interactive UI -->
    <section id="interface">
      <h2>Interactive User Interface</h2>
      <p><strong>Lead:</strong> Julia Cotterrell</p>
      <p>
        Julia’s work created a full-stack web interface integrating the TweetyProject reasoning engine, a Spring Boot API, and a React front-end.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> Verified through testing — outputs matched RC definitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Local execution under 100 ms per query.</li>
        <li><strong>Usability:</strong> Expert feedback confirmed clarity and transparency, improving interpretability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Contribution:</strong> The first tool to make RC reasoning both interactive and pedagogically accessible.</p>
